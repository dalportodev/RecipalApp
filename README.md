# AllrecipeKillerApp

VERY IMPORTANT, IF ANDROID STUDIO ASKS IF YOU WANT TO ADD A .IDEA\VCS.XML FILE TO GIT WHILE WORKING ON THE PROJECT
SELECT NO AND TO NOT ASK AGAIN. .IDEA\VCS.XML FILES ARE IDE DEPENDENT AND ADDING THEM TO GITHUB WILL CAUSE FILE CONFLICTS.

I ADDED A .gitignore FILE TO EXCLUDE THESE BUT JUST IN CASE YOU NEVER WANT TO COMMIT THESE FILES TO GIT
.gradle
/local.properties
/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea/libraries
.DS_Store
/build
